# Fake Client

You will need to run server.py and get a URL for the game. I used the VSCode Ports tab to forward the server but you can do whatever ig.

Exploit.py is an example script you can use that sends the script to the server after 1 sec delay to pretend its doing stuff.

Server.py runs the server that the game checks for anything to run.

> If you want to use the Exploit.py in it's current state you will need to have the bloxlib folder too
